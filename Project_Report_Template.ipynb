    "title: Predicting Match Outcomes in League of Legends Using Logistic Regression\n",
    "subtitle: Project Report for STAT 303-2 Winter 2025\n",
    "author: JOANNA JUNG\n",

    "abstract: In this analysis, I examined the early-game factors that contribute to victory in Diamond-ranked League of Legends matches, focusing on the first 10 minutes of play. The findings highlight that gold difference, jungle farming efficiency, and level advantage are the strongest predictors of a team’s likelihood of winning. Teams that secure an early gold lead while efficiently farming jungle camps and minions significantly increase their odds of victory, as these factors compound over time. For esports coaches and analysts, this means emphasizing strategies that optimize early-game gold acquisition and jungle control. Players can use these insights to prioritize objectives and farm efficiently to sustain their leads. Game developers may consider balancing adjustments if early-game advantages are disproportionately determining match outcomes. However, the analysis has limitations, including the lack of champion-specific interactions, team strategies, and real-time decision-making data. Future work should incorporate additional contextual variables, test models across different ranks and patches, and explore more complex machine learning techniques to improve predictive power. \n",

    "In constructing our final model, I chose to use only blue team variables rather than incorporating both blue and red team statistics. This decision was based on the observation that blue team metrics alone provided sufficient predictive power without redundancy. When both teams' data were included, many features were highly correlated with one another (e.g., blueGoldDiff and redGoldDiff are essentially the same but in opposite directions), leading to redundancy in the model without adding new information. By selecting only blue team variables, I aimed to create a more interpretable model while maintaining high accuracy.\n",

The five selected predictors— blueGoldDiff, blueTotalJungleMinionsKilled, blueAvgLevel, blueCSPerMin, and blueTotalMinionsKilled— consistently showed the highest contribution to predicting game outcomes. These features directly influence gold accumulation, experience gains, and farming efficiency, which are the most reliable indicators of team strength."

Other interaction terms (e.g., blueGoldDiff * blueCSPerMin, blueTotalJungleMinionsKilled * blueTotalMinionsKilled) also have perfect collinearity. This is a problem because multicollinearity makes coefficient estimates unstable."

    "Looking at the model summary, we can see that the Pseudo R-squared value is 0.222. This means the model explains 22.22% of the variation in blueWins compared to a null model that only includes an intercept, which indicates a moderately strong predictive ability. The model is significantly better than random guessing (R^2 = 0). However, there is still 77.78% of variation unexplained, which could be explained by adding more variables. "

    "For esports coaches and analysts, the key takeaway from this analysis is that early-game advantages, particularly gold difference, jungle farming, and level leads, are crucial for setting up a win. Since blueGoldDiff was the strongest predictor of victory, teams should focus on securing a gold lead through efficient farming, early objective control, and kill conversions. Players can apply this by prioritizing dragons and towers and making sure their gold advantage leads to action rather than passive farming. Since this analysis only looks at the first 10 minutes of Diamond-ranked games, these findings are most relevant for high-level play, where small advantages can snowball quickly. For Riot Games, this data might highlight potential balance concerns—if gold or jungle control is too dominant, adjustments may be needed to keep matches competitive rather than one-sided from the start.\n",

    "While the model offers valuable insights, it comes with some important limitations. The biggest one is that correlation doesn’t mean causation—just because a gold lead strongly correlates with winning doesn’t mean simply increasing gold guarantees a win. The model also lacks real-time decision-making context—it only looks at game stats, not the choices players make in response to their opponents. Things like team communication, rotations, and overall strategy are missing from this data. Another major gap is that the analysis doesn’t factor in champion matchups, player skill, or team compositions, all of which can completely change how a game plays out. There’s also the issue of scope—since this data only comes from Diamond-ranked games, the findings might not hold for lower-ranked players, where mistakes and playstyles are different, or for Challenger-level games, where coordination is much tighter. Finally, the model’s pseudo R-squared of 0.2222 tells us that while it captures some of what leads to a win, a lot of variation remains unexplained."

    "To improve on this analysis, future work should bring in more contextual data—things like champion picks, team compositions, and player rankings could provide a clearer picture of how early-game decisions influence the rest of the match. It would also be useful to repeat this analysis across different ranks or game patches to see if the same trends hold, since strategies that work in Diamond might not be as effective in lower or higher tiers. Finally, expanding the dataset to track games beyond the first 10 minutes would give a better understanding of how early leads translate into mid and late-game wins, rather than just assuming a strong start always leads to victory."

    "My analysis shows that in Diamond-ranked League of Legends matches, early-game advantages in gold, jungle farming, and level leads play a major role in determining the outcome. Teams that build a gold lead while efficiently farming jungle camps and minions set themselves up for success, as these factors work together to create a snowball effect. That said, the model only captures part of the picture—it doesn’t account for champion matchups, team strategy, or what happens after the 10-minute mark, which are all crucial in shaping a game. To get a fuller understanding, future work should bring in more contextual data and explore more complex models to better capture the dynamics of high-level play."
